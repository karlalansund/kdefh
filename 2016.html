<h1>Top 5 Greatest World Series Games of All Time</h1>
<h2>#1, 2016 World Series, Game 7</h2>
<p>The 2016 World Series quickly became the most hyped up World Series of all time because of what was on the line for
    both the Chicago Cubs and the Cleveland Indians. The Chicago Cubs were haunted by the "Curse of the Billy Goat", a 108
    year title drought, the longest in professional sports at the time. The Cleveland Indians owned the second longest
    drought in baseball having not won a title since 1954. Things began to look bleak for the Chicago Cubs as the Cleveland
    Indians took a commanding 3-1 series lead. With a sequence of timely hits and a great bullpen, the Chicago Cubs tied the
    World Series back up a 3-3. Come game 7 the Chicago Cubs jumped out to an early lead. Going into the bottom of the 8th
    inning Rajai Davis faced elite closer Aroldis Chapman down by 2 and with a runner on base. Davis hooked one around the
    pole to tie the game and the Chicago Cubs and Cleveland Indians went into extra innings and a game 7 for the first time
    since 1991. Going into the top of the 10th there was a 40 minute rain delay which only raised the stakes. After the delay
    the Chicago Cubs knocked a few base hits off of Bryan Shaw and Ben Zobrist nailed the coffin shut with a 2-run double.
    Rajai davis came back up in the bottom of the 10th and singled in a run but not before Michael Martinez grounded out to
    Kris Bryant to end the Chicago Cubs 108 year World Series title drought.</p>
