<h1>Top 5 Greatest World Series Games of All Time</h1>
<h2>#3, 2001 World Series, Game 7</h2>
<p> With the New York Yankees seek their fourth World Series title in a row in the wake of the 2001 World Trade Center
Attacks they were the obvious "Team of Destiny" in all of sports. However the scrappy Arizona Diamondbacks had other
ideas. Down 2-1 in the top of the 9th inning, the Arizona Diamondbacks put in perennial all-star and Hall-of-Famer
Randy Johnson into the game to hold the score. He did just that. Going into the bottom of the 9th, the New York Yankees
put in the greatest closer of all-time and Hall-of-Famer, Mariano Rivera. With a walk and a double from Tony Womack the
score was tied. Mariano Rivera quickly forced the bases loaded and sent Luis Gonzalez to the plate. Gonzalez hit a bloop
single over Derek Jeter's head scoring Craig Counsell and the Arizona Diamondbacks won the World Series. This is the
fastest a team has won the World Series after becoming a team, the Arizona Diamondback were established in 1998 and won
a World Series in their fourth season.</p>
