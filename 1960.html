<h1> Top 5 Greatest World Series Games of All Time</h1>
<h2> #4, 1960 World Series, Game 7</h2>
<p> Tied 9-9 going into the bottom of the ninth inning, the Pittsburgh Pirates sent second baseman Bill Mazeroski to
the plate to face Ralph Terry. Mazeroski hit a homerun to left-center and the Pittsburgh Pirates won 10-9. This shocking
feat stunned the baseball world as it showed the powerhouse known as the 1950s-60s New York Yankees with legends such as
Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, and Roger Maris were not invincible.
 Mazeroski hit the only walkoff homerun in game 7 of a World Series in its 115 year history.</p>
