<h1>Top 5 Greatest World Series Games of All Time</h1>
<h2>#5, 1993 World Series, Game 6</h2>
<p>Down 5-6 and on the verge of the Philadelphia Phillies forcing a game 7, Mitch "Wild Thing" Williams allowed two
    baserunners with Joe Carter coming up to the plate. On a 2-2 count Carter hooked
    a homerun around the left field pole and won 8-6. Carter hit the first walkoff homerun in a World Series clincher
    in 33 years. This was the Toronto Blue Jays' first World Series win in franchise history and the first World Series
    won by a Canadian team.</p>
