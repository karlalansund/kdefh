<h1>Top 5 Greatest World Series Games of All Time</h1>
<h2>#2, 1956 World Series, Game 5</h2>
<p> In 1956 a feat happened that will probably never happen again in baseball. Don Larsen threw a perfect game in the
World Series, 27 up, 27 down. Perfect games are already hard enough to obtain as the last one happened in 2012 by Felix
Hernandez. The closest anyone has come to a perfect game in the World Series since was a no-hitter in the National League
Division Series by Roy Halladay in 2010. This is again impressive because he blanked the Brooklyn Dodgers with players
such as Jackie Robinson, Duke Snider, and Roy Campanella. The New York Yankees later beat the Brooklyn Dodgers in game 7.</p>
